# ThoughtBubble

## ThoughtBubble is a blog web application using Flask microframework where users can post snippets of their everyday philosophical thoughts. This is a fun project for me as it introduces me how to build a simple web application using Flask.

This is still a work in progress but so far here are the features:
1. Users can register and make an account
2. The application will do error checking on register forms
3. Once a user is registered, they can login and edit their profile such as editing their email and changing their profile picture.

Here are all the packages I am using so far:
